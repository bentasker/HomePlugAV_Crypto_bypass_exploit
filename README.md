HomePlugAV Crypto Bypass Exploit
====================================

This repo contains simple scripts to demonstrate the attack details in [Inflitrating a network via Powerline Adapters](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/security/282-infiltrating-a-network-via-powerline-homeplugav-adapters).

The scripts in this repo were shared at the time the issue was discovered (and the above article written), but it seems I never got quite as far as moving my internal repo over to Github.

It's been 6.5 years since the issue was discovered, so there isn't really anything new within this repo.
